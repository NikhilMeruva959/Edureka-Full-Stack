1. Copy keyes into .env file
2. we need an external library from the paytm website code- 
-> download PaytmChecksum.js and put it in the controllers folder, do not change it
-> need 5 packages from npmjs.com
    - dotenv: to read the contents of .env file
    - formidable: to deal with form data
    - uuid: generate a unique id for every payment
    - https: to secure the communication with paytm server
    - crypto: required by the PaytmChecksum.js
-> Now we will create the 2 apis
    - /payment
    - /paymentCallback
