//// Components in React

- the functionality in React is divided in Components
    - functional
    - class based


- simple react app: if you want to add reactJS to an existing HTML page
    - I have to add the CDN lnks for the react library
    - I need an HTML element under which I will render other HTML Elements using react
    - I need a script tag where I will write the React code
        1) create a JS class extends from React Library
        2) Render the JSX provided by class under the HTML element

- create-react-app utility
    npx create-reacta-app my-second-react-app


//// nesting of Components


//// Passing data from parent component to child component
    - props: is used to pass data from parent component to child component
    - in react, the flow of data is uni-directional (flows from parent component to child component)
    - props is immutable: changing the props is not possible

    Two ways of passing the data:
        (1) Between the tags
        (2) As an attribute of the tag


//// Local data of a component

    - state: it is used to hold the data of a component
    - state is mutable: you can change the state
    - setState method to update the state
        1) updates the state
        2) it triggers the render function again
